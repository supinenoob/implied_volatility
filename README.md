I wanted to create an IV indicator that helps improve entry timing when trading options
## IV Indicator
The Bayes IV uses past IV data to find probabilistic likelihood of the true IV value by contrasting it with the IV value obtained from the Black-Scholes-Merton model

The data of three well established companies were used so that the Black-Scholes-Merton model assumptions would more appropriately apply. (GOOG, AMZN, & APPL)
